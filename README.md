Data Cleaning & Preparation Project
ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive data cleansing workflow in Microsoft Excel, focused on improving the accuracy, consistency, and integrity of datasets. 
The raw dataset contained a variety of common data quality issues such as duplicates, extra spaces, blank values, formatting inconsistencies, and misspellings.

The objective of this project was to transform messy, inconsistent data into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready dataset suitable for reporting and compliance purposes.

ðŸ”¹ Key Steps & Techniques

Data Formatting

Autofit rows/columns for readability.

Standardised number, date, and currency formats.

Duplicates & Errors

Used Conditional Formatting and Remove Duplicates to identify and eliminate duplicate records.

Applied IFERROR to handle missing or invalid calculations gracefully.

Text Cleaning

Applied TRIM function to remove extra/hidden spaces.

Performed spell check and corrected common errors.

Handling Missing Values

Filled blank cells using bulk update techniques (e.g., Ctrl+Enter).

Replaced missing entries with placeholders like TBA.

Data Validation & Consistency

Built dropdown lists to prevent incorrect entries.

Converted dataset into an Excel Table for structured data handling.

Error-Free Reporting

Cleaned and standardised financial-style columns for accurate calculations.

Used Find & Replace for bulk corrections across datasets.
